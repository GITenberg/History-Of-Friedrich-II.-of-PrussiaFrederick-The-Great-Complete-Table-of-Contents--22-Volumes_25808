
INSTRUCTIONS:

This is a multi volume index file

The index has links to all volumes.

Follow these instructions if you would like to have your own copy of this index and all the volumes of CARLYLE, on your hard disk. Doing so will allow this index to be used with all the many links to the volumes and chapters when you are not connected to the internet:

3. Go to your Download Directory and double-click on the downloaded file (25808-h.zip), and move the directory 25808-h to this or any other directory you would like. Then double-click on 25808-h; you will see several directories: you may rename the directory named files to any name you wish, such as CARLYLE. You may move this file to any directory on your computer.

4. In the newly named directory containing all the eBooks in this set
you will find a file named INDEX.HTM in capital letters, this html file
can only be used here; a shortcut to it may be installed on your desktop
or any directory on your computer. This index file or its shorcut allows
you to open all of the OFF-LINE files, chapters and illustrations in
this set now on your hard disk. The name of the SHORTCUT may of course
be renamed as you wish, for example: CARLYLE INDEX.


When using the index or any of the files you may use the BACK button to return from any link.
